## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management & Cloud Security

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/Aaniket09)**  
  Coming soon.... 

- **[Cloud-based IDS/IPS Deployment in OpenStack](https://github.com/Aaniket09/Openstack_Snort)**  
  Built attacker-victim lab in OpenStack, tuned Snort rules to detect TCP SYN flood attacks with 90%+ accuracy, aligned with NIST 800-53 standards.

## 🚨 Threat Detection & Automation

- **[Azure Honeynet Security Implementation](https://github.com/Aaniket09)**  
  Deployed a honeynet in Azure, ingested logs into Microsoft Sentinel, and created KQL rules for advanced detection. Hardened workloads with RBAC,      SSO, and firewall policies.
  
- **[DLL Injection Threat Detection Automation](https://github.com/Aaniket09/DLL-detection-using-python-and-ghidra)**  
  Developed a Python script to identify DLL injection techniques (MITRE T1055.001), achieving 80% detection accuracy and improving incident triage      efficiency.

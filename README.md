## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management & Cloud Security

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/Aaniket09/vulnerability-management-program)**

  Deployed Nessus Essentials to scan and remediate critical CVEs across a Windows/Linux hybrid environment, reducing risk score by 40%.
  
- **[Windows 11 Pro STIGS Implementation](https://github.com/Aaniket09/STIGS-Implementation-Automation)**

  Engineered PowerShell scripts to automate DISA STIG compliance, **achieving 100% adherence to critical security baselines** for endpoint hardening.
  
- **[Cloud-based IDS/IPS Deployment in OpenStack](https://github.com/Aaniket09/Openstack_Snort)**  

  Engineered a private cloud lab. **Diagnosed and manually patched a critical Python race condition in Keystone (Identity Service)** to restore availability, and tuned Snort rules to detect       volumetric DoS attacks.

## 🚨 Threat Detection & Automation

- **[AI SOC Agent for Azure Sentinel](https://github.com/Aaniket09/AI-SOC-Agent)**

  Architected a custom SOAR pipeline using OpenAI APIs to auto-analyze Sentinel alerts, reducing manual triage latency by 70%.
  
- **[Threat Hunt: Ghost Support Session](https://github.com/Aaniket09/Threat-Hunt-Nov-2025-Cyber-Range)**  

  Investigated a "Ghost Support" intrusion scenario using Azure Sentinel. Engineered KQL queries to map the full kill chain, identifying PowerShell-based persistence, defense evasion artifacts, and data exfiltration staging.
  
- **[DLL Injection Threat Detection Automation](https://github.com/Aaniket09/DLL-detection-using-python-and-ghidra)**  

  Developed a Python script to identify DLL injection techniques (MITRE T1055.001), achieving 80% detection accuracy and improving incident triage efficiency.   

## 📝 Technical Writing

- **[Medium Blog: Security Engineering & Automation](YOUR_MEDIUM_PROFILE_LINK_HERE)**

  Documenting my engineering process, from writing KQL detection logic to automating SOC workflows with Python.
